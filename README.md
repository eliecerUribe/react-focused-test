# React focused test
I answer some questions about Javascript, CSS and React

### Javascript ###
* What is your favourite new javascript feature and why?

Optional chaining.
You can reduce the words you type when you to validate if a key exists in a object. For example: 
```javascript
    const person = { address : { postcode: 06710 } }
```

* Explain an interesting way in which you have used this javascript feature.
* Is there any difference between regular function syntax and the shorter arrow function syntax? (Write the answer in your own words)
* What is the difference between ‘myFunctionCall(++foo)’   and  ‘myFunctionCall(foo++)’
* In your own words, explain what a javascript ‘class’ is and how it differs from a function.

### Css ###
* In your own words, explain css specificity.
* In your own words, explain, what is ‘!important’ in css.  Also how does it work?  Are there any special circumstances when using it, where it’s behaviour might not be what you expect?
* What is your prefered layout system: inline-block, floating + clearing, flex, grid, other?  And why?
* Are negative margins legal and what do they do (margin: -20px)?
